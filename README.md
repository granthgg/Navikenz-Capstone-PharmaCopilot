# Navikenz-Capstone-PharmaCopilot
This is a repository for my Capstone project for my Training Under Navikenz. This consist of the Project- PharmaCopilot which is a system designed to optimize and efficiently manage the Pharmaceutical Drug Manufacturing preventing the batches from defect and increasing the Production efficiency using various AI system.

## Project Directories
This repository consists of 4 directories currently:
- Data: This consists of the All Datasets used for this Project.
- Documentations: This consists of all Documentations created for this project to provide guide to the project.
- EDA: This consist of EDA code files. Which were used to analyze and understand about the datasets in detail.
- Code: This consists the All the code for modeling different Phases of the project with their respective outputs.

## Project Introduction
Forecast-then-Act Quality Control with Gen AI Reports system - "PharmaCopilot". 
Project requires three core capabilities:
1.	Time-series forecasting of Sensor Values and Classifier for quality and defect prediction
2.	Reinforcement Learning (RL) control for process optimization
3.	Generative AI reporting for regulatory compliance
