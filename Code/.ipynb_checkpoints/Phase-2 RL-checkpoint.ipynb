    "# Reinforcement Learning System for Pharmaceutical Process Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements Phase 2 of the pharmaceutical manufacturing optimization project, moving from passive prediction to active control through Reinforcement Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Create an intelligent RL agent that observes manufacturing process states and recommends optimal parameter adjustments to maximize batch quality and efficiency while minimizing defects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "1. **PharmaGym Environment**: Custom OpenAI Gym environment simulating pharmaceutical manufacturing\n",
    "2. **State Representation**: Current process state + LSTM forecasts + static features + time features  \n",
    "3. **Action Space**: MultiDiscrete actions for speed, compression force, and sampling rate adjustments\n",
    "4. **Reward Function**: Multi-objective function considering defect probability, test costs, compliance, and downtime\n",
    "5. **Conservative Q-Learning**: Offline RL training on historical batch data\n",
    "6. **Safety Layer**: Operational limits enforcement for all agent actions\n",
    "7. **Backtesting**: Evaluation on held-out batches vs historical performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integration with Phase 1\n",
    "- **LSTM Model**: Provides 30-minute sensor forecasts for state representation\n",
    "- **XGBoost/GB Classifiers**: Used in reward function to estimate defect probability  \n",
    "- **Historical Data**: 1005 batches used for offline RL dataset creation\n"
